# Hi, I'm Filip 👋
The following are my current main interests but I'm always looking for the next innovative tech. 

## Web Apps 💻
I mainly use Gatsby.js for the basic static websites and React for anything dynamic. You can check out the websites I've developed [here](https://filipigic.co.uk).
## Mobile Apps 📱
For mobile apps I use react native with AWS for the backend.
## Quantum Computing ⚛
I've had fun learning all about quantum computing during my [final year project](https://github.com/filipigic/final-year-project) at university and I still do some work as a hobby.
